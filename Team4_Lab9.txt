Group 4: Brandon Geren, Kevin Henry, Michael Shanahan

Part 1 Questions
1. What are control flags?
  Control flags exist to tell the control unit what to do and where to send data.
2. Which control flags are set during an Add instruction (Think of flags that control
the ALU and Register File)?
  e a inv, b inv, alu op, and write enable 
Part 2 Questions
1. How do you end an if statement in VHDL?
  Each IF statement needs an END IF; to stop the process
2. Why should a control unit be sequential?
  Processes may need to be completed in a certain order to ensure that the program operates correctly
3. How do you check if the clock is on the rising edge in VHDL?
  ELSIF(rising_edge(Clock)) THEN 
4. How would you write the following C Code in VHDL?
/*TA told me i didnt need the process stuff that would be above this begin*/
  BEGIN
    IF(X = '01') THEN
      y = '00;
    ELSIF (x = '10') THEN
      y = '01';
    ELSE
      x = '00';
    END IF;
  END PROCESS;
END behavior;
Final Questions
1. What components are used in stage 3 of our processor? Remember, stage 3 is the
execute stage.
2. What should alu op be set to for an XOR instruction?
00000
3. What happens when reset is 1?
4. What control signal is assigned in stage 5 for a Sub instruction?
